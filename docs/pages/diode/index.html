    <h1>i present you the different type of diode</h1>
    <h2>we can't realy say the date of the first diode because there was a lot of different diode for a lot of usage the one that are consider like a pionner is the  Fleming valve</h2>

<h3>light emiting diode</h3>

<h4>one of the most common like most of the diode it consist of a semi-conductor but this type have special element in it to make the release photon when electron pass trought them</h4>
<h3>laser diode</h3>
<img src="img/laser diode.webp">
<h4>this type of diode has generaly a realy high consumption compare to the light emiting diode due to the fact that this type of diode is use to cut metal an also for medical industrie </h4>
<h3>Photodiode or photoelectric diode</h3>

<h4>this type of diode emit little voltage when exited with light</h4>
