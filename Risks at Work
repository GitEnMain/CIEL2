Object : Website for risks at work

Dear colleagues,

A few weeks ago, a Cabinet of Risks at Work, service of www.gov.uk,
asked us to create a website (for all systems) to evaluate some situations
for workers and how they have to protect themselves.
                              
This cabinet wants us to give some help for workers if they are in an office,
in front of a computer, in a garden, in a construction site, in a factory
(dangerous machine)…
                              
You have to make a mockup (draw.io eg) to show your prototype and then
you must create this website with at least 5 different situations.
You must add a help page to use the website too.
You must use CSS file and GIT versioning (in local repository).
You have 3 weeks to make this website!
                              
A report (PowerPoint document) will be sent to our service to control it.
Sorry, it’s a government request…

                            
Your direction team
